I'm currently a theoretical chemistry PhD candidate at Leiden University (graduating April 2026). I really enjoy science but my true passion is coding.

I mostly code in Python, Julia, and Rust (with Rust being my favorite), but I've
done some stuff with JavaScript, Solidity, and C++ as well. 

## What I enjoy working on
- Scientific simulation software
- Blockchain projects
- Data processing & numerical computing
- Performance optimization
- Building CLIs in Rust

## Open to work
Interested in **backend software engineering** and **scientific computing** roles. Feel free to reach out!
